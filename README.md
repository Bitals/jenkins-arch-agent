An Archlinux Docker container ready to act as a Jenkins Agent, intended for building and maintaining a custom Arch Repository.

This branch is a WIP. My homelab is down right now due to ZFS zvol being **awfully** slow, so not tested 
in any way yet.
Here I aim to completely rewrite a currently very unreliable implementation of a VCS package updater, while also getting rid of aurutils-plugins dependency.
